# WebSocket Echo (Twisted-based)

This example shows a WebSocket echo server that will echo back any WebSocket message it receives to the client that sent the message.

It also includes a WebSocket client that will send a WebSocket message every second to the server it connected to. The Python client is available in two variants.

Lastly, a HTML5 client is also included.

This example uses the Twisted integration of **Autobahn**|Python. You can find the corresponding example using the Asyncio integration [here](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python/tree/master/examples/asyncio/websocket/echo).

## Running

    python server.py

and open

    client.html

in your browser.
