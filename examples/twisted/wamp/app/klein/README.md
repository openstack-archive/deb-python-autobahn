## WAMP-Klein Application

The examples here demonstrate how to combine a [Klein](https://github.com/twisted/klein) Web application with a Autobahn WAMP application. Klein essentially is Flask for Twisted Web.

A detailed discussion of Example 1 (see below) is here:

 * [Mixing Web and WAMP code with Twisted Klein](http://crossbario.com/blog/post/mixing-web-and-wamp-code-with-twisted-klein/)

* [Example 1](example1): minimalistic; runs Web and WAMP app in different processes
* [Example 2](example2): more extended; runs Web and WAMP app in same process
