*Open-source (MIT) real-time framework for Web, Mobile & Internet of Things.*

|AbL| is part of the `Autobahn`_ project and provides open-source implementations of

* `The WebSocket Protocol <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455>`__
* `The Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP) <http://wamp.ws/>`__

in Python 2 and 3, running on `Twisted`_ **or** `asyncio`_.

Autobahn Features
-----------------

`WebSocket`_ allows `bidirectional real-time messaging <http://crossbario.com/blog/post/websocket-why-what-can-i-use-it/>`_ on the Web while `WAMP`_ provides applications with `high-level communication abstractions <http://wamp.ws/why/>`__ (remote procedure calling and publish/subscribe) in an open standard WebSocket-based protocol.

|AbL| features:

* framework for `WebSocket`_ and `WAMP`_ clients
* compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.3+
* runs on `CPython`_, `PyPy`_ and `Jython`_
* runs under `Twisted`_ and `asyncio`_
* implements WebSocket `RFC6455`_ (and draft versions Hybi-10+)
* implements `WebSocket compression <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-permessage-compression>`__
* implements `WAMP`_, the Web Application Messaging Protocol
* supports TLS (secure WebSocket) and proxies
* Open-source (`MIT license <https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python/blob/master/LICENSE>`__)

...and much more.

Further, |AbL| is written with these goals:

1. high-performance, fully asynchronous and scalable code
2. best-in-class standards conformance and security

We do take those design and implementation goals quite serious. For example, |AbL| has 100% strict passes with `AutobahnTestsuite`_, the quasi industry standard of WebSocket protocol test suites we originally created only to test |AbL| ;)

.. note::
   In the following, we will just refer to |Ab| instead of the
   more precise term |AbL| and there is no
   ambiguity.


What can I do with Autobahn?
----------------------------

WebSocket is great for apps like **chat**, **trading**, **multi-player games** or **real-time charts**. It allows you to **actively push information** to clients as it happens. (See also :ref:`run_all_examples`)

    :scale: 40%
    :align: right

Further, WebSocket allows you to real-time enable your Web user interfaces: **always current information** without reloads or polling. UIs no longer need to be a boring, static thing. Looking for the right communication technology for your next-generation Web apps? Enter WebSocket.

And WebSocket works great not only on the Web, but also as a protocol for wiring up the **Internet-of-Things (IoT)**. Connecting a sensor or actor to other application components in real-time over an efficient protocol. Plus: you are using the *same* protocol to connect frontends like Web browsers.

While WebSocket already is quite awesome, it is still low-level. Which is why we have WAMP. WAMP allows you to **compose your application from loosely coupled components** that talk in real-time with each other - using nice high-level communication patterns ("Remote Procedure Calls" and "Publish & Subscribe").

WAMP enables application architectures with application code **distributed freely across processes and devices** according to functional aspects. Since WAMP implementations exist for **multiple languages**, WAMP applications can be **polyglot**. Application components can be implemented in a language and run on a device which best fit the particular use case.

WAMP is a routed protocol, so you need a WAMP router. We suggest using `Crossbar.io <http://crossbar.io>`_, but there are also `other implementations <http://wamp.ws/implementations/>`_ available.

Show me some code!

A sample **WebSocket server**:

.. code-block:: python

   from autobahn.twisted.websocket import WebSocketServerProtocol
   # or: from autobahn.asyncio.websocket import WebSocketServerProtocol

       class MyServerProtocol(WebSocketServerProtocol):

          def onConnect(self, request):
              print("Client connecting: {}".format(request.peer))

          def onOpen(self):
              print("WebSocket connection open.")

          def onMessage(self, payload, isBinary):
              if isBinary:
                  print("Binary message received: {} bytes".format(len(payload)))
              else:
                  print("Text message received: {}".format(payload.decode('utf8')))

              ## echo back message verbatim
              self.sendMessage(payload, isBinary)

          def onClose(self, wasClean, code, reason):
              print("WebSocket connection closed: {}".format(reason))

A sample **WAMP application component** implementing all client roles:

.. code-block:: python

    from autobahn.twisted.wamp import ApplicationSession
    # or: from autobahn.asyncio.wamp import ApplicationSession
    class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

       @inlineCallbacks
       def onJoin(self, details):

           # 1) subscribe to a topic
           def onevent(msg):
               print("Got event: {}".format(msg))
           yield self.subscribe(onevent, 'com.myapp.hello')

           # 2) publish an event
           self.publish('com.myapp.hello', 'Hello, world!')

           # 3) register a procedure for remoting
           def add2(x, y):
               return x + y
           self.register(add2, 'com.myapp.add2');

           # 4) call a remote procedure
           res = yield self.call('com.myapp.add2', 2, 3)
           print("Got result: {}".format(res))
